## ⚡ Quick Downloads

> **Note:** All APKs are automatically rebuilt daily at 06:00 UTC to ensure you have the latest features and security patches.

### 📥 Download Links

| Mirror | Description | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GitHub Releases** | Primary source. Contains all builds. | [**Download Latest Release**](https://github.com/teyd/Morphe-AutoBuilds/releases/latest) |

### 📱 Supported Apps & Architectures

| Application | Source | arm64-v8a | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **YouTube** | morphe | ✅ | `youtube` |
| **YouTube Music** | morphe | ✅ | `youtube-music` |
| **Reddit** | morphe | ✅ | `reddit` |
| **X (Twitter)** | piko-newx | ✅ | `x-new` (crimera/piko-newx) |
| **Instagram** | piko | ✅ | `instagram` |
| **TikTok** | icysymmetra | ✅ | `tiktok` |

*( All apps ship `arm64-v8a` builds, named `<app>-arm64-v8a-<source>-v<version>.apk`. )*

---

## 📲 Auto-Updates via Obtainium

All builds are published to the single rolling release tag **`latest`**, with one newest APK per app. Add each app to [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) with:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **App Source URL** | `https://github.com/teyd/Morphe-AutoBuilds` |
| **Override Source** | GitHub Releases (HTML is fine) |
| **Filter Release Titles by Regex** | leave empty for all, or narrow when needed |
| **APK Filter Regex** | per-app regex from the table below |
| **Version Extraction** | `-v([\d.]+)` (captures the version from the APK filename) |

> **Filename note:** APKs are named `<app>-<arch>-<output-name>-v<version>.apk`, where `<output-name>` is the `name` declared in `sources/<source>.json` — e.g. the `piko` and `piko-newx` sources both emit `piko-patches`. Use exactly the regexes below.

| App | APK Filter Regex |
| :--- | :--- |
| YouTube | `^youtube-arm64-v8a-morphe-v.*\.apk$` |
| YouTube Music | `^youtube-music-arm64-v8a-morphe-v.*\.apk$` |
| Reddit | `^reddit-arm64-v8a-morphe-v.*\.apk$` |
| X (Twitter) | `^x-new-arm64-v8a-piko-patches-v.*\.apk$` |
| Instagram | `^instagram-arm64-v8a-piko-patches-v.*\.apk$` |
| TikTok | `^tiktok-arm64-v8a-morphe-patches-v.*\.apk$` |

Replace `arm64-v8a` with `armeabi-v7a` or `universal` in the regex if you build other architectures. Builds without a version change are carried over untouched, so Obtainium only sees an update when an app's version (or patch set) actually changes.

## ✨ Key Features

This repository utilizes a robust Python-based pipeline to ensure high reliability and optimization.

* **Fully Automated:** GitHub Actions workflow executes daily at 06:00 UTC, requiring zero manual intervention.
* **Architecture Optimization:** Builds specific `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, and `universal` APKs to reduce file size and improve performance on target devices.
* **Multi-Source Strategy:** Intelligent fetching from APKMirror, APKPure, and Uptodown ensures high success rates even if one source is down.
* **Granular Patch Control:** Simple text-based configuration allows for precise inclusion or exclusion of specific patches.
* **Smart Failover:** The system automatically switches download sources if a fetch attempt fails.
* **Auto-Signing:** All APKs are signed with a consistent public keystore, making them ready to install immediately.
* **Clean Release Cycle:** Previous releases are replaced rather than archived, preventing clutter and making it easy for external managers (like Orion) to track updates.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

This builder is highly configurable. You can adjust the following files to customize the build output.

### 1. App Selection (`patch-config.json`)

Define which applications the pipeline should attempt to build.

```json
{
  "patch_list": [
    { "app_name": "youtube", "source": "morphe" },
    { "app_name": "youtube-music", "source": "morphe" },
    { "app_name": "X", "source": "crimera" }
  ]
}

```

### 2. Architecture Matrix (`arch-config.json`)

Specify which CPU architectures to target for each application.

```json
[
  {
    "app_name": "youtube",
    "source": "morphe",
    "arches": ["arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a", "universal"]
  },
  {
    "app_name": "youtube-music",
    "source": "morphe",
    "arches": ["arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a"]
  }
]

```

### 3. Source Definitions

Located in the `apps/` directory. Example for `apps/apkmirror/youtube.json`:

```json
{
  "org": "google-inc",
  "name": "youtube",
  "type": "APK",
  "arch": "universal",
  "dpi": "nodpi",
  "package": "com.google.android.youtube",
  "version": ""
}

```

### 4. Patch Rules

Located in `patches/`. Example for `patches/youtube-morphe.txt`. Use `+` to force include and `-` to exclude.

```text
# Essential patches
+ microg-support
+ premium-heading
+ hide-infocard-suggestions

# Exclusions
- custom-branding
- amoled

```

## 🚀 Local Build Instructions

If you prefer to build the APKs on your own machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* `zip` utility
* `apksigner` (part of Android SDK Build-Tools)

### Installation & Execution

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teyd/Morphe-AutoBuilds.git
cd Morphe-AutoBuilds

```


2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

```


3. **Run the build:**
You can build for a specific app and source.
```bash

python -m src

```


4. **Target specific architecture (Optional):**
```bash
export APP_NAME="youtube"
export SOURCE="morphe"
export ARCH="arm64-v8a"  # Options: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, universal
python -m src

```

## 🔄 Syncing with Upstream (RookieEnough)

This repository is a **fork** of [RookieEnough/Morphe-AutoBuilds](https://github.com/RookieEnough/Morphe-AutoBuilds). Upstream is configured **fetch-only** — nothing is ever pushed, committed, or opened as a PR to RookieEnough's repo.

When upstream fixes or improves something (workflows, `src/`, `scripts/`), pull it in:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main          # or: git rebase upstream/main
# resolve conflicts (see below), test locally, then:
git push origin main
```

**Conflict rules** — this fork only diverges in build configuration, so conflicts should stay confined to:

| File | Our version |
| :--- | :--- |
| `patch-config.json` | 6 apps: youtube, youtube-music, reddit (morphe), x-new (piko-newx), instagram (piko), tiktok (icysymmetra) |
| `arch-config.json` | all 6 apps with `arm64-v8a` |
| `patches/*.txt` | our per-app include/exclude rules |
| `README.md` | fork badges, app table, Obtainium guide |

Everything else (`src/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`, `sources/`, `apps/`) is kept **identical to upstream** on purpose, so merges stay trivial. If a change is needed there, it belongs upstream — if RookieEnough won't take it, keep the local edit as small and separate as possible.

Verify the safety rails at any time:

```bash
git remote -v
# origin    ...github.com/teyd/Morphe-AutoBuilds.git     (fetch + push)
# upstream  ...github.com/RookieEnough/Morphe-AutoBuilds.git (fetch)
# upstream  no_push
```
